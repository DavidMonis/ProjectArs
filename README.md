# ProjectArs

**Co-op strategy + adaptive AI teammates.**  
A story-driven cooperative strategy game where you play with friends â€” or with an **adaptive AI partner** that can stand in for a missing player and gradually learns your playstyle.

## Vision
Create a new story-first cooperative strategy experience and develop **AI teammates** that can seamlessly replace humans and adapt over time.

## Roadmap (High-Level)
- **Year 1 â€” Foundations:**  
  Simple strategy loop (build â†’ gather â†’ train â†’ final battle), lightweight leaderboard on the site. Learn the basics of ML, build a first PyTorch agent, and try a beginner Kaggle competition. Weekly devlogs and public GitHub.
- **Year 2 â€” Integration:**  
  Connect the AI agent to the custom game; design a more capable agent; draft a narrative skeleton for a simple multiplayer story game; continue outreach (Shorts, maybe Patreon).
- **Year 3 â€” Expansion:**  
  Build the planned simple story-strategy multiplayer title; deepen AI specialization; start next-yearâ€™s applied agent; grow community (Discord/Forum).
- **Year 4 â€” Application:**  
  Deliver an agent that can actually play the new game well and ship it; evaluate commercial options.

## Weekly Rhythm (Year 1)
Alternate focus between **Game Engines (1, 2)** and **Thesis Project (1, 2)**.  
Publish weekly progress to YouTube and the thesis page, then post a combined update to the ProjectArs site.

## Progress
Updates will appear on the websiteâ€™s **Progress** tab.
